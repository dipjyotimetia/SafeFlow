# Troubleshooting

## Import parser misses rows

- Re-upload a cleaner PDF (non-scanned when possible).
- Verify account/provider selection before import.
- Manually edit problematic rows after import.

## Totals look wrong

- Check account opening balances.
- Inspect duplicate imports.
- Review transfer transactions for mirrored entries.

## Investment values stale

- Open **Investments** and click **Refresh Prices**.
- Check internet access for market data providers.
- Confirm symbols are valid for the selected asset type.

## AI assistant not connecting

- Ensure Ollama is running.
- Verify host URL and model name in **Settings**.
- Test connection from the Settings panel.

## Sync errors

- Re-check provider credentials.
- Confirm encryption password.
- Export a local backup before retrying operations.

## Last-resort data recovery

1. Export current data (if possible).
2. Import the latest known-good backup.
3. Reconcile balances and key categories.
